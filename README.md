# pyaudio-build-wheel

Build [PyAudio](https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/) **unofficial**
wheels for newer versions of python.

PyAudio is not authored or maintained by me, it is maintained by Hubert Pham.
This repo only contains code for building unofficial wheels from the publicly
available PyAudio source code.

This is currently a work in progress.
